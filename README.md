# JSON API

This project goal is create easy-to-use library to implement JSON API specification.

Whole project is at the beginning of development. So don't hesitate to help.
I'm open to some good ideas how make this more customizable and friendly.

This library is tested in production with Doctrine2 and SlimPHP.

Library only provides wrappers to create valid JSON API document. Controllers and Response is on you.
